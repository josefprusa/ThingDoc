 What is ThingDoc?
*******************
ThingDOC is a clever things comment parser
It generates a BOM and hopefully full documentation in near future :-)
A BOM is a Build of Materials. This is the "what you'll need" info sheet with each thing you need tabulated and organized.

*******************
 HOW DO I USE IT?
*******************
The workflow is as follows:
To run thingdoc:
cd into the folder containing your things. Currently .scad and .tdoc files are supported

run:
python PATH_TO_THINGDOC/thingdoc.py

you will get a whole lot of output
for each file that is read, you will get a recognition statement that it is found and parsed
If you have LaTeX installed you will get a docs/doc.pdf with Complete documentation for all your things.

Optionally, you can specify which files you want to output.  The default is the bom.txt file and the doc.tex file.

Print only the bom.txt:
	python PATH_TO_THINGDOC/thingdoc.py --bom
Print only the doc.tex:
	python PATH_TO_THINGDOC/thingdoc.py --latex
Print only the wiki.txt:
	python PATH_TO_THINGDOC/thingdoc.py --wiki
	
The wiki text is formatted to fit in with the reprap.org wiki.
	
*******************
   IS IT MAGIC?
*******************
Yes, it is magic.

*******************
 HOW DOES IT WORK?
*******************
Thingdoc identifies long comments in your things. The will start with:
/**
and end with:
*/

The first line in the comments sets the description of the thing.

within each set of comments, there are keywords. Keyword always starts with "@"
several keywords are supported:
@name sets the name of the thing
@link sets the link to the thing
@assembly tells us the assembly instructions for the thing
@assembled tells us that this thing is made up of other things, and so it won't be shown in BOM and etc.
@category sets the category of the thing, like "Printed" to tell you you will need to print this thing
@root in large things that are made up of many smaller things, this is the topmost parent thing
@using sets the dependency between things. parent things use child things.
@common thing soo common it won't be shown in things reviews etc. but will be shown in BOM. you can probably find these things in a local hardware store.

*******************
More details on some keywords:
@name
Simply the name of the thing * @name M8 nut

@link
Unique url style link to the thing. Automagically is generated from the filename where comment was found by removing file extension. You can rewrite it by using this keyword * @link m8nut

 WHO IS TEH AWESOME?
**********************
Thingdoc was conceived of and is being developed by Josef Prusa. It is currently running as the documentation engine for the RepRap Prusa Mendel. See: http://github.com/prusajr/PrusaMendel for more awesometown.
